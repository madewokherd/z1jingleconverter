
Converter for ZORA Randomizer (https://github.com/tetraly/zora) from LilyPond format to a jingle (recorder theme) usable in a Zelda 1 ROM, in Python.

To use:

Run z1.ly in LilyPond. This will convert the snippets of music in the file to .bin files.

To patch a recorder theme into a Zelda 1 ROM with a .bin file:
python3 patch.py zelda1.rom filename.bin

On Windows 10, if this doesn't do anything, try running python3 with no arguments, to make sure Python 3 is actually being run and it's not just the builtin stub that opens the Windows store.
